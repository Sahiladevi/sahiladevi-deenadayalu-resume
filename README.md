#Create and Deploy Resume
=============================

Create a second-site to host additional websites.

Create Resume by adding the external css file and index.html file

> ##Notes:
If username.github.io already exists, it’s considered your personal website repository, and you can’t create another GitHub Pages site using that exact name. However, you can still host additional websites under the same GitHub account by creating project-specific repositories.

Here’s how you can do that:
===========================

Create a new repository with a custom name, for example, my-second-site or anything else you prefer.

Add your static site files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to this repository, either locally or via GitHub’s web editor.

Push your files to GitHub.

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to the repository settings.
Under the GitHub Pages section, choose the main branch (or gh-pages branch if you use that) to deploy the site.
Access your new site:

The URL for the new site will be in the format: https://username.github.io/my-second-site/
This way, you can have multiple static websites under the same GitHub account, each with its own repository and accessible through a sub-path of your main GitHub Pages domain.
